        <p>
            You decide to stay with the forest spirit, intrigued by him. You follow Rowan through the 
            thinning forest, his silhouette little more than a shadow against the deepening dusk. The 
            trees grow taller here, their branches intertwining overhead to form a dense canopy that 
            filters what little light remains. A soft, electric hum pulses in the air, as though the 
            forest itself is whispering secrets you’re not yet ready to hear. You arrive at a clearing 
            unlike any you’ve seen before. The ground is thick with moss, 
            soft beneath your feet, and the light is dim and tinted silver, like moonlight sifted 
            through water. Every breath feels slower and heavier. 
            Tiny sparks of light flicker at the edges of your vision. Rowan stops just at the edge and 
            turns to face you. He doesn’t speak. He never does.
            <br>
            <br>
            But his eyes meet yours, glowing faintly in the gloom. Slowly, he tilts his head and 
            gestures toward the heart of the grove with a gentle sweep of his hand. You hesitate. 
            The air feels alive here, like it’s holding its breath. The path ahead is unclear, the 
            shadows unfamiliar.
            The deeper you walk, the more the world seems to quiet around you. No birdsong, no breeze. 
            Just the distant hum, like a song with no words, threading through the trees. And 
            now — fireflies. They drift lazily through the air in soft, golden pulses, swirling around 
            Rowan’s shoulders and dancing just ahead of you, as if guiding your steps. One lands briefly 
            on your hand before lifting off again, leaving a faint warmth behind.
            <br>
            <br>
            You step further, the stillness thick around you. At first, you see nothing. Just the void 
            between trees, the cool breath of night. But then—as your eyes adjust and the fireflies 
            gather—the darkness begins to shift. Faint shapes shimmer into view, not on stone, not carved 
            or written—but suspended in the air itself, like mist catching light.
