        <p>
            You step through the door, leaving the quiet room of books behind
            —and wake with a gasp.
            Smoke stings your throat.
            Your eyes fly open to a world thick with heat and flame. The library—once quiet and 
            timeless—is burning. Fire curls up the shelves, devouring paper and wood alike. The 
            windows glow orange. Ash rains down like snow.
            <br><br>
            You’re still in the chair where it all began.
            The book lies in your lap, its cover hot beneath your fingers—but untouched. You 
            clutch it to your chest.
            Coughing, heart pounding, you stumble to your feet. A beam groans overhead, 
            glass shatters. You don’t look back.
            <br><br>
            You run.
            <br><br>
            Through the smoke, down the narrow aisle, past the place where stories once 
            whispered—until you burst through the doors into the cold, clean air outside.
            You fall to your knees, gasping.
            <br><br>
            The book is still in your hands.
            You hold it tighter, soot smudging the leather cover, the memory of fire still 
            clinging to your skin. And even now, even here, the weight of it is unmistakable—
            like it remembers, too.
