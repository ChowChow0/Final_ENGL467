        <p>
            You spend a week with Elara, helping her care for the villagers.
            The fever still clings to the village like a fog—thin but persistent. 
            Yet something begins to shift. You don’t fall sick, even after days spent 
            tending to the ill, wiping brows, breathing in the same heavy air. Not even a 
            cough. And stranger still, those you touch seem to ease. They sleep better. The 
            color returns to their cheeks.
            At first, Elara chalks it up to hope. Then she sees the pattern.
            “It’s you,” she murmurs one dusk as you help her lift her mother into a more 
            comfortable position. “You’re keeping it at bay.”
            <br><br>
            You shake your head, but something inside you already knows it’s true. There’s 
            something flowing through you—an echo of Rowan’s presence, a quiet warmth that lingers 
            beneath your skin.
            When the village is stable enough to breathe again, you and Elara climb the mountain 
            path back to the grove.
            Rowan is waiting.
            He stands beside the willow, the wind brushing against him like it knows him—like it 
            listens. When his eyes meet yours, they soften. He takes a step forward, then another. 
            For the first time, he doesn’t stop at the edge of the clearing. He crosses it.
            <br><br>
            “Elara,” he says.
            <br><br>
            You freeze. His voice is gentle, low, like distant thunder wrapped in leaves. It’s the 
            first time you’ve heard it. Even Elara stares, stunned.
            “The curse,” he says, meeting your gaze now. “It’s lifting.”
            You realize then: it was never just about breaking rules or saving lives. It was about 
            balance. About trust. About not bearing the burden alone. The forest had been waiting—for 
            connection, for harmony. For someone who could channel its healing without forcing it.
            <br><br>
            You.
            <br><br>
            Rowan steps forward and places a hand over yours. His fingers are cool, his touch light—but 
            not fragile. He is still a spirit. Still part of the earth, the trees, the roots that run 
            beneath your feet.
            But now he speaks.
            Now he chooses.
            And with the vial he offers—a silver fluid drawn from the wellspring of the grove—you help 
            finish what he began.
            <br><br>
            Together, you, Elara, and Rowan heal the village. Slowly. Patiently. Not through grand 
            miracles, but through quiet ones: shared meals, clean water, long nights, gentle songs. 
            The sickness fades. The people live. And the forest grows strong again.
            Rowan remains.
            He walks beside you, his silence no longer a barrier, but a choice. He smiles more. Speaks 
            when it matters. Laughs, once—just once—at something Elara says, and it sounds like water 
            meeting stone.
