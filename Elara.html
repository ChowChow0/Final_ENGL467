        <p>
            You wake to the scent of damp earth and something faintly floral—sweet, 
            unfamiliar. The ceiling above you is wooden, crosshatched with beams and 
            cobwebs, and sunlight spills in through cracks like honey through lattice. 
            You're not in your room. You don’t remember falling asleep here.
            <br><br>
            You sit up slowly. The bed is soft but strange, covered in a patchwork 
            quilt stitched with tiny golden threads. The room around you is old—older 
            than anything you've known—with crooked shelves stacked high with scrolls, 
            pressed flowers, and bottles filled with glowing dust.
            <br><br>
            A chill traces your spine. You rise and cross the creaking floor to the 
            mirror hanging crookedly on the wall. When you look up— She looks back.
            The girl from the cover. The one you stared at for so long before opening 
            the book. You blink, she blinks. You touch your face, and so does she.
            <br><br>
            You stagger back. This isn’t a dream.
            Outside the cottage, the world seems to breathe. Trees rise like titans, 
            their shadows falling in long streaks across mossy ground. The forest murmurs 
            to itself, whispering with the wind, but there's a wrongness to it. Something 
            watching. Something waiting.
            You never go beyond the edge of the clearing.
            <br><br>
            Days pass. Or maybe weeks. The sun sets too slowly, or too fast. The moon 
            doesn't always rise where it should. You flip through the pages of the book 
            you found on the table—"The Summer the Forest Spoke"—but the middle is missing, 
            and your name is written in curling ink on the dedication page.
            <br><br>
            Sometimes, you swear you hear a voice calling your name from between the trees.
            But you don’t answer. You don't go in. And no matter how far you walk in any 
            direction, you always end up back at the cottage.
            Because you’re not just IN the story.
            You ARE the story.
            And the book never ends.
