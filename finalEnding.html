        <p>
           You speak the word aloud—the one you’ve pieced together from whispered clues.
            The air shivers.
            The room seems to hold its breath.
            And then—the narrator’s voice shifts. No longer distant, no longer guiding from the shadows.
            The voice softens, no longer distant but near, filled with relief and quiet gratitude.
            <br><br>
            “That word you spoke... it was my true name. The secret I have guarded through every 
            twist and turn of this story. Bound by it, I was trapped—unable to leave, unable to 
            change. But now, with my name spoken aloud, I am released.”
            <br><br>
            A calm warmth spreads through the room, and you feel the weight of countless stories 
            lift from the air.
            “Thank you,” he whispers. “Because in speaking my name, you have freed me—and the 
            story along with me.”
            <br><br>
            Light floods the space, warm and steady, as if a heavy weight lifts from the very air.
            The voice that has followed you, that has woven the story around your steps, 
            now sounds lighter, kinder.
            “Thank you,” he says softly. “Because you remembered me.”
            <br><br>
            The world around you brightens—words dissolve into glowing threads, stories 
            unfolding into the sky like stars breaking free from their cages.
            You feel the story shift beneath your feet, the boundaries between reader and narrator fading.
            And as the final page turns, you realize:
            <br><br>
            You didn’t just change the story.
            You released it.
            And him.
            <br><br>
            The book closes softly in your hands, and you walk out of the room and exit the library.
            Outside, the world feels different—lighter somehow, as if the stories themselves are 
            breathing freely at last.
            You take a deep breath, the cool air filling your lungs, and with one last glance 
            back at the building, you step forward—ready to carry the freedom of the story 
            with you wherever you go.
