        <p>
            You step through the door, leaving the quiet room of books behind—and wake with a start.
            Your head jerks upright. The library swims into view.
            You’re back in the chair where it all began, blinking against the late afternoon 
            light slanting through the tall windows. The room is just as it was: shelves towering 
            around you, quiet and still with the faint rustle of nearby 
            pages and the gentle tick of the old clock on the wall.
            <br><br>
            Had you dozed off?
            The book lies open in your lap, exactly where you left it… and yet, the pages are 
            turned to a passage you don’t remember reading. You touch the cover. It’s warm.
            <br><br>
            Your heart is still racing.
            You close your eyes, just for a moment—and you see him. Rowan. Elara. The grove.
            You breathe out slowly.
            It felt so real.
            <br><br>
            And as you rise to leave, the weight of the book in your hands feels heavier than 
            it should—like it remembers too.
