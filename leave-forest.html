            In the end, you decide to follow Elara. The forest feels too vast, too uncertain, and with the 
            sun setting fast, you realize you have no place to stay. As much as Rowan intrigued you, his 
            silence and strangeness left you uneasy—like he belonged to a different world entirely. Elara, 
            on the other hand, felt grounded. Real. She offers a small smile as you fall into step beside 
            her, and without a word, begins leading you through a narrow path laced with tangled roots and 
            low-hanging branches. The trail winds gently downhill, the air growing cooler, and soon the 
            trees begin to thin.
            <br>
            <br>
            Lights bloom in the distance like scattered stars—warm, golden, welcoming. The village is 
            quiet as you enter, tucked into the folds of the valley like a secret. The homes are simple, 
            built from wood and stone, and smoke curls lazily from chimneys. It feels safe here, safer 
            than the forest with its humming air and whispering shadows. You glance at Elara, unsure. “I 
            don’t know where to go…”
            <br>
            <br>
            “You can stay with me,” she says, as if it’s the easiest thing in the world. Gratefully, 
            you accept. Her cottage sits at the edge of the village, where the lanterns are fewer and 
            the silence of the trees still hums faintly. Inside, it’s cozy—a hearth, a woven rug, books 
            stacked in uneven piles. She shows you a small bed in the corner, tells you to rest, and 
            disappears into her own room. But rest doesn’t come. The night presses in through the shutters. 
            You lie awake, turning over the day’s strange encounters in your mind. Finally, you rise, 
            slipping out into the cool night air.The village is hushed. The moon hangs low and pale, and 
            the stars glitter faintly overhead. As you wander past Elara’s garden and toward the edge of 
            the trees, something catches your eye. A flicker of light. Then another. Fireflies.
            <br>
            <br>
            They dance slowly in the stillness, like tiny sparks drifting through the air. You follow 
            their gentle path, feet moving instinctively, deeper into the grove beyond the last cottage. 
            The air grows thick with quiet, and the fireflies gather closer around you, their glow pulsing 
            softly. You pause, curiosity tugging at your tired thoughts, and look closer into the darkness 
            just ahead.At first, you see nothing—just shadows, just the cool night air. But then, as your 
            eyes begin to adjust, faint shapes start to form—hovering, drifting in the space before you.
