        <p>
            You wake up lying on a bed of moss, damp and cool against your back. 
            Sunlight filters through a green canopy above, casting shadows that 
            flicker like candlelight. You sit up slowly, your head spinning. 
            The air smells like pine and something older—earth soaked in time.
            <br><br>
            You don't know where you are.
            You look down. Your hands aren't yours. They're rougher, broader. There's a 
            scar across the knuckle you don’t recognize. The clothes hanging from your 
            body are unfamiliar—stitched from coarse fabric, laced at the chest, damp at 
            the hems with dew.
            <br><br>
            "What the...?" you murmur, but even your voice sounds off. Deeper. Softer.
            You stand and turn in a slow circle. The forest is endless in every direction, 
            dense and quiet. You pick a path—any path—and walk. But the forest twists 
            unnaturally, folds in on itself. Landmarks reappear where they shouldn’t be. 
            Trees seem to lean toward you when you’re not looking.
            <br><br>
            You speak.
            “Where am I?”
            The words echo strangely—once, then not at all. The moment hangs too still.
            Then, a strange pressure creeps over you. The air thickens. Your limbs feel heavy.
            Your breath catches. Something in the back of your mind stirs—a memory that 
            doesn’t belong to you.
            You feel it then. Not like a flash of vision, but like something being 
            returned to you. A name. A role. A silence.
            <br><br>
            You weren't supposed to speak.
            You remember now—the vow Rowan made, the guardian of the forest, the one 
            whose voice held magic and memory, and who gave it up to keep the forest alive.
            And you just broke it.
            You stagger, trying to deny what you already know. You’re not just in Rowan’s body.
            You ARE him now.
            <br><br>
            And as your edges begin to fade, as the trees blur and forget your shape, 
            your name slips from the world like mist in the morning.
            You were supposed to be silent.
            And now, you’ll never be remembered.
