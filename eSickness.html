        <p>
            You spend a week with Rowan in the grove, days folding into one another like petals. 
            He can’t speak, but he doesn’t need to. In the hush of the forest, his gestures say enough. 
            You learn to understand the way he tilts his head when he’s amused, the way his eyes soften 
            when he’s grateful. You learn how to move through the grove without disturbing its breath, 
            how to listen to the silence between sounds. And slowly, you feel the forest opening to 
            you too—its quiet rhythms, its ancient patience.
            <br>
            <br>
            You help him tend to the clearing. You gather water, you rest your palm against the bark of 
            the willow when he does. You start to feel it: the pulse of something older than language 
            humming in your chest, just beneath your skin. You don’t ask questions. You simply stay.
            Then—Elara returns.
            She stumbles into the grove just after sunset, pale and trembling, her breath short and ragged. 
            Rowan is at her side in an instant, catching her as she falls. You rush to them both, heart 
            pounding, the weight of the moment settling over you like fog.
            <br>
            <br>
            “Elara,” you breathe. Her skin burns beneath your touch. “The sickness…”
            Rowan lowers her gently onto the moss. His jaw tightens. He looks at you, then back at her, 
            and you see it—the same decision in his eyes. The same sorrow.
            But this time… he doesn’t move alone.
            He reaches for your hand.
            At first, you don’t understand. But then you feel it: a pull deep inside you, like your 
            heartbeat is syncing with something just beyond you. The forest hum sharpens, brightens. 
            The willow stirs.
            Rowan closes his eyes. You close yours too.
            <br>
            <br>
            The air begins to shimmer. Light coils through the grove, golden and slow, rising 
            from the roots of the willow like breath. You feel it rush through you—not painful, 
            but full. Like something ancient passing through your chest. Rowan speaks.
            Just one sentence.
            Not to you. Not to her. But to the grove itself.
            And this time, he doesn’t vanish.
            The light flares, then dims. Elara gasps and sits up, color returning to her cheeks. She’s drenched in sweat, but the fever is gone. Her eyes are clear.
            <br>
            <br>
            You turn to Rowan.
            He’s still there.
            But something’s changed. The glow in his skin—the shimmer in his eyes—is gone. 
            The forest hum no longer vibrates in him. He stands blinking at his hands like he’s 
            seeing them for the first time.
            Mortal hands.
            He stumbles slightly, and you catch him, just as he caught Elara.
            He looks at you—not with sorrow, but with awe.
            <br>
            <br>
            You realize then: because you were there, because you bore part of the weight, he didn’t have 
            to break entirely. You were the bridge. The vessel. The anchor.
            He gave up the forest, but not his life.
            And he gave it up willingly, for her.
            The next morning, the sickness was gone from the village. The water ran clear. The breath 
            of the trees felt lighter. No one could explain it. No one tried.
            Elara recovered quickly. Her mother, too. Mira danced again.
            Rowan stayed.
            Not as a spirit. Not as a god.
            But as a man—quiet, kind, unfamiliar with his new heartbeat but learning to live inside it.
