        <p>
            You don’t look back. Whatever that voice was—whatever this place was—you’ve had enough. The rows of books 
            begin to blur past you as you walk, then jog, then nearly run, heart pounding as if trying to race ahead of 
            your thoughts. But slowly, almost imperceptibly, the strangeness fades. The air grows still again. 
            The floorboards creak in a way that feels… normal.
            <br>
            And then, as if no time had passed at all, you step back into the familiar dim light of the library’s 
            main hall. Dust floats through golden shafts of sunlight. The smell of paper and old wood welcomes you like a memory.
            <br>
            You glance back once—just once—but the hallway behind you is dark, empty. Silent. No trace of the door. 
            No sign of the whispering voice.
            <br>
            You’re safe. But a question lingers in the back of your mind, quiet and persistent:
            <br>
            What would’ve happened if you had stayed?
        </p>
