        <h3 class="fade-text">You open your eyes.</h3>
        <p>
            You find yourself in a forest, surrounded by towering trees. 
            It's midday—the sun hangs high in the sky, but the air is cool, thanks to a gentle 
            breeze weaving through the branches. The leafy canopy filters the light, casting  
            shadows across the forest floor.

            What was that? A message… but from who?
            You strain to recall. The last thing you remember is touching the book—and then, 
            a voice. Distant. Speaking directly to you…

                        In the village, it was said that the forest woke up in summer. The trees whispered 
                        louder, the birds sang more vibrantly, and strange lights moved between the trunks 
                        at dusk. Most villagers stayed away from the woods once the flowers bloomed, heeding 
                        old tales about spirits who watched from between the mossy trees.
                        <br>
                        But <a href="Elara.html" class="altStory">Elara</a> had never been afraid of the forest. She was eighteen when she first wandered 
                        too far from the path and found herself in a clearing she'd never seen before. A soft 
                        mist clung to the grass, and in the center stood a willow tree with branches that 
                        swept the earth like a curtain of green silk. Beneath it stood a figure. He was clothed 
                        in layers of ivy and shadow, with hair like dark bark and eyes like mossy stone. He 
                        watched her not with surprise, but with quiet attention. He did not speak, only 
                        inclined his head.
                        <br>
                        That summer, they began to meet in the glade. She spoke often. He always listened and 
                        never said a word. At first, she thought he was shy. But eventually, she asked him 
                        directly, fingers brushing his, voice barely louder than a hush:  “Why don’t you speak?” 
                        He didn’t answer with words, only touched his throat and then laid a hand over his heart. 
                        The look in his eyes said enough. He couldn’t. Not wouldn’t. Couldn’t.
                        <br>
                        As the seasons passed, Elara learned the truth in pieces. From old stories half-buried 
                        in the village's memory. From the way birds would fall silent when he passed, or how 
                        flowers leaned toward him. A forest spirit, a keeper of balance, born of root and wind. 
                        Bound to silence by ancient law, for a voice like his could stir the sky or awaken rivers.
                        <br>
                        He could move wind with a flick of his hand and coax flowers to bloom from dry stone. 
                        But if he spoke, it was said, the forest would take him back. So he remained silent. 
                        And still, she loved him. He taught her to listen to the wind as it curved around tree 
                        trunks, to the hidden voices in the river and morning dew. When she asked questions, 
                        he answered with a look, a gesture, the way his fingers danced over the moss like 
                        reading a second language written in roots. She called him <a href="Rowan.html" class="altStory">Rowan</a>, after the trees 
                        that marked the forest’s edge. He never confirmed it, but he smiled when she used 
                        the name.
                        <br>
                        When the leaves began to yellow, he vanished. But the next summer, he returned. And 
                        again the one after. Each year, Elara would find the path more easily, as though 
                        the forest remembered her. And each summer, Rowan stood waiting in the clearing, 
                        greeting her with a smile. For six summers, they met beneath the willow’s veil. But 
                        then, the seventh summer came, and everything changed.
                        <br>
                        First, the birds stopped singing. Then the deer vanished. A stillness fell over the 
                        village like the hush before a storm. Then came the fever. It moved fast—too fast. 
                        One child sickened, then three more by dawn. Whole families burned with fever, 
                        curling beside cold hearths, slipping into silence. Elara’s sister, Mira, was the 
                        first to fall in her home. Her father next. Then her mother coughing blood by the 
                        fire, too weak to speak.
                        <br>
                        The village panicked. Some cursed the river. Others wept at forgotten shrines. But 
                        the oldest blamed the forest. The balance had been broken, they said. They had 
                        angered the spirits. Elara knew one of them. Rowan. She ran to the grove, barefoot 
                        and breathless, lungs burning with every step. Her cries echoed through the trees, 
                        calling his name. He was waiting for her. But this time, he did not smile.
                        <br>
                        His eyes—those gentle eyes—were heavy with sorrow. He reached forward, brushed dirt 
                        from her cheek and held her fingers in his. “Rowan,” she gasped. “Please. My 
                        family—everyone—they’re dying.” He only looked at her, and in his gaze, she could 
                        see it: he already knew. A cough tore through her, sudden and sharp, doubling her 
                        over. Rowan caught her before she fell. Blood spattered her lips. Her vision swam. 
                        The fever had come for her too. 
                        <br>
                        He knelt beside her, gently lowering her to the ground. His touch was cool, 
                        like springwater, but it could not slow the heat building beneath her skin. 
                        Tears gathered in her lashes. “You can fix this, can’t you? You’re part of the 
                        forest.” Still, he did not answer. He didn’t explain. He didn’t need to. Her body 
                        trembled in his arms.
                        <br>
                        “I can draw it out,” he said softly. “But only once.” She understood. Speaking had 
                        already broken part of what bound him. What he was about to do would unmake the rest.
                        “No,” she croaked. “No, you don’t have to—” He smiled. “I do.”
                        <br>
                        He rose and turned toward the willow. The air thickened. Light flickered at the 
                        edges of the clearing. In a low voice, almost a whisper, he said a single sentence. 
                        It was in a language she didn’t understand, but she knew enough of what it meant. 
                        The wind howled and branches bent in reverence. A golden light erupted from the roots 
                        and swallowed the grove whole. Elara felt the fever leave her in a great rush, like 
                        smoke drawn out from the fire. Her lungs filled with clean air. Her vision cleared.
                        <br>
                        But Rowan—Rowan was already unraveling. Light split through him like cracks in porcelain, 
                        his body dissolving into the air with every heartbeat. The forest was calling him back, 
                        unmaking him with quiet finality. He looked down at her, his eyes full of all the words 
                        he never had the time to say. And in a voice so faint it could’ve been the wind, he whispered,
                        “At least now… I can finally say how much I loved our time together.”
                        <br>
                        The next morning, the sickness was gone. Mira opened her eyes. Elara’s mother could 
                        finally breathe. The water ran clean, the air fresh. No one could explain it. Elara 
                        never spoke of Rowan again. Some things were not meant to be told. But every summer, 
                        she returned to the willow grove. She brought flowers. Sat in silence. Remembered. 
                        He had broken his vow not for glory or gratitude—but to save what she loved. He had 
                        chosen her over eternity. And in that fragile, fleeting love, the forest spoke at last.

        <p>
            Not knowing what else to do, you pick up the book—the one that had practically called to you 
            and start walking. The forest around you deepens with every step, the trees growing taller 
            and the shadows thicker, as if the very path is pulling you further into the world of the story.
            The silence is broken by the soft crunch of your boots on mossy ground. Then, up ahead, you 
            spot a figure cloaked in green and grey, standing still among the trees. His hood obscures his 
            face, and when you step closer, he simply stares at you—silent, unreadable.
        </p>

        </script>
        <p>
            Before you can press further, a sudden rustle breaks the quiet. You turn just as a young 
            woman steps cautiously from behind a tree. Her eyes scan the grove, landing first on the 
            cloaked figure, then on you. She looks thin. Worn. Her eyes are shadowed with worry.
            “I… I had to come,” she says softly. “I couldn’t keep it from you any longer.”
            The forest stills around you. Even the birds seem to listen.
            “There’s something wrong in the village,” she continues, voice trembling. “People are falling 
            ill. It started with a cough, then fever, and now… they’re not waking up.”
            She wrings her hands. “I’m not sick. Not yet. But I don’t know how long that will last. 
            I had to tell you, Rowan.”
            <br>
            <br>
            The cloaked figure—Rowan—remains silent, though the air seems to tighten 
            around him. You’re about to speak when realization washes over you like a wave.
            <br>
            <br>
            Elara.
            <br>
            <br>
            The name doesn’t come from memory, but from the whisper of the story itself. You’re inside 
            the novel—and she’s the protagonist. A sudden pressure blooms in your chest. 
            Make a good impression. This matters.
            Rowan remains motionless, the folds of his cloak shifting slightly in the breeze. 
            His face is shadowed, unreadable—still lost in thought, as if weighing something only he can see. 
            The forest air feels dense with his silence. So you turn to Elara.
            <br>
            <br>
            “I know this might sound strange,” you say gently, “but maybe… we can pass the time together. 
            Play a game?” She blinks, surprised. But something softens in her expression—a flicker of relief. 
            “A game?” she echoes. Then, after a beat, a small smile forms. “Alright. What are my choices?”
            You offer her three.
        </p>
        <h3>Choose a Game to Teach Elara</h3>

        <div class="button-container">
            <a href="tic-tac-toe.html" class= "begin-btn">Tic Tac Toe</a>
            <a href="drawing.html" class="begin-btn">Drawing</a>
            <a href="number-guess.html" class="begin-btn">Number Guessing</a>
        </div>
        <p>
            The sun begins to dip behind the trees, casting long shadows and bathing the grove 
            in a golden hush. Elara rises, brushing leaves from her skirt.
            “I should head back,” she says quietly. Then, with a glance toward you, her voice turns 
            heavier. “They’ll need help—there aren’t enough hands left. And I can’t shake the feeling 
            that… whatever’s causing this, it’s only just begun.”
            She hesitates.
            <br>
            <br>
            “You can stay here, if you’d like. It’s safer in the woods. But—” her eyes meet yours, 
            earnest and unsure “—if you’re willing, I’d feel better not going alone.”
            She doesn’t ask outright, but the question lingers in the air.
            <br>
            <br>
            Just then, Rowan shifts. He doesn’t speak—he never does—but he steps closer, the silver 
            of his cloak catching the last light of day. His eyes meet Elara’s for a long, 
            unreadable moment… and then he gives a subtle nod.
            Not permission. Not warning.
            Support.
            Then he turns, retreating a few steps into the trees, as if to give you space to decide.
            Elara’s eyes return to you.
            <br>
            <br>
            Will you stay in the forest, or follow her back to the village?
