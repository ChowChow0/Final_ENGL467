        <p>
            You don’t stay long in the village after the healing. A day, maybe two. Long enough 
            to help Elara tend to those still recovering. Long enough to watch the weight begin to 
            lift from their eyes.
            But not long enough to feel like you belong here.
            The air shifts.
            A ripple, like a page turning.
            You step back instinctively, and suddenly the world around you begins to dissolve: 
            the moss beneath your feet, the shimmer of fireflies in the air, the image of the village 
            fading into shadow.
            <br><br>
            You wake in the library.
            No sound. No footsteps. Just the rustle of unseen pages.
            You’re back in the room, the book closed in front of you. Your fingers still rest on the cover.
            Someone clears their throat behind you.
            <br><br>
            You turn.
            <br><br>
            The narrator stands there—no longer hidden in the margins, but whole. 
            They tilt their head at you, half curious, half amused.

            The narrator watches you a moment longer, then smiles—not with approval or warning, 
            but with the kind of wonder reserved for stories that grow beyond their endings.
            Then they’re gone—slipped between the shelves like a shadow between words.
            You look down.
            The book is still in your hands.
            Its cover is worn, the edges singed faintly with gold, like the last trace of magic 
            refusing to fade. You tuck it beneath your arm—carefully, reverently. Not because you 
            plan to read it again, but because you lived it. And somehow, that feels different.
