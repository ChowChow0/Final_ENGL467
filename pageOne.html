        <p class="reveal-type"> 
            You wake up in a dark, dimly lit library, the soft glow of a few remaining lamps casting long 
            shadows over the rows of bookshelves. It's quiet, too quiet, and for a moment, you wonder how 
            long you've been asleep. The musty scent of old paper fills your nose, and you rub your eyes, 
            realizing that it must be long after closing time.
            <br>
            You stretch, feeling the weight of tiredness still clinging to you, but reading no longer holds 
            your interest. You stand, deciding to walk around and stretch your legs. The library feels vast 
            in the silence, the towering shelves of books almost pressing in on you as you meander down aisles 
            without any real purpose.
            <br>
            But then, you hear it. A soft whisper, barely perceptible, as if the very books themselves are 
            speaking. You freeze. Was someone else still here? The sound is faint, and yet, it's oddly magnetic, 
            pulling you forward, urging you to follow. Before you even realize it, you're walking down the aisles, 
            each step bringing you deeper into the maze of shelves. The whispers grow louder, but there’s no one 
            in sight, no sign of where it’s coming from. 
            <br>
            You feel strangely entranced, as though the library itself is guiding you. It’s easy to forget about 
            the outside world, to lose track of time and space as you follow the sound, winding your way deeper 
            through the labyrinth of bookshelves. But then it hits you—you’re lost. Completely and utterly lost. 
            <br>
            The whispers have stopped, and you're standing in an unfamiliar aisle, unsure of how you even got here. 
            Panic sets in as you turn in every direction, trying to find your bearings. There’s nothing familiar, 
            just endless rows of books, stretching in all directions.
            <br>
            You continue to wander, heart racing. Then, as if by fate, you stumble upon a door. You don't hesitate, 
            stepping inside, hoping it will lead you to an exit. The door shuts behind you with an echo that 
            reverberates in your chest. 
            <br>
            You try to open it again, but it won’t budge. The door is locked.
            <br>
            Turning around, you find yourself in a large, circular room, the walls lined with bookshelves. 
            In the center, four stands hold four books, each with a different cover. The books seem to call out to you, 
            each one promising something different, something more.

                <p class="reveal-type">
                    You step closer to the first stand. The book resting there is a romance, its cover a soft, faded red. 
                    Two figures are caught in a tender embrace, but their faces are hazy, blurred beyond recognition. 
                    No matter how long you stare, their identities remain just out of reach, as if the story refuses to 
                    reveal them until the pages are turned.

                <p class="reveal-type">
                    The second stand holds a fantasy novel. Its cover gleams with shimmering silver and gold, depicting a 
                    majestic castle rising above enchanted forests. Yet at the very center of the image, there is a curious 
                    empty space—a hollow gap where something important should be, as if a vital piece of the world was quietly erased.

                </button>
                <p class="reveal-type">
                    The third stand displays a mystery. The cover is drenched in darkness, broken only by the harsh glow of 
                    a lone, flickering street lamp. Beneath it, a solitary silhouette stands motionless, casting a long shadow 
                    across the pavement. The scene feels less like an invitation and more like a warning.

                </button>
                <p class="reveal-type">
                    The fourth book, perched on the final stand, is a thriller. Its cover is stark and chilling, dominated by 
                    the image of a distant figure lurking just out of focus. The longer you look, the more you feel the weight 
                    of unseen eyes upon you. A ripple of unease crawls down your spine, the tension practically seeping from the page.
